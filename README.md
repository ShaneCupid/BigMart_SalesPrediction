# BigMart Sales Prediction

## Overview
This repository is home to the BigMart Sales Prediction project, which aims to forecast the sales of different products across various BigMart outlets. Utilizing historical sales data, the project applies machine learning techniques to predict sales and uncover insights into factors affecting product sales.

## Technologies Used
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/doc/) - The primary programming language used for data analysis and predictive modeling.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The interactive computing environment for developing the project code.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - Utilized for numerical operations on array-based data.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) - Employed for creating static, interactive, and exploratory visualizations in Python.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Used for making statistical graphics in Python.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - Implemented for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Description
The BigMart Sales Prediction project involves:

- Data preprocessing to clean and structure the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and patterns.
- Feature engineering to extract and select relevant information.
- Predictive modeling to forecast sales.
- Evaluation of model performance and tuning to improve predictions.

### BigMart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb
- **Input**: `Train.csv` for training the model and `Test.csv` for evaluating performance.
- **Process**: 
  - Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Detailed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and insights.
  - Feature selection and engineering to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
  - Training various regression models to predict sales.
  - Fine-tuning models and selecting the best performer based on evaluation metrics.
- **Output**: Predicted sales figures and a report on the factors influencing sales.

## How It Works

### Data Preparation
- Load and clean data using Pandas.
- Handle missing values and categorical data encoding.
- Normalization and scaling of features.

### Exploratory Analysis
- Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data for better understanding and insight extraction.

### Predictive Modeling
- Implement and compare multiple regression algorithms using Scikit-Learn.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics to determine the best performing model.
